This package contains whole configs, meaning that each folder in here contains all different config
to make a game session. This include:
* Audio config
* Battle config
* Construct config
* Game config
* Graphic config
* Map config
* Surface config

This is quite unsustainable in the long-term. The goal should be that all config
reside in one single .json file, and use our JSONReader library
